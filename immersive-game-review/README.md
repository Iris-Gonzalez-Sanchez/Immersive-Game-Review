## CORE DELIVERABLES
‚úÖ Make a single page application (only one index.html file) using create-react-app.

‚úÖ The app should use at least 5 components in a way that keeps the code well organized.

‚úÖ There should be at least 3 client-side routes using React Router. Include a nav bar or other UI element that allows users to navigate between routes.

‚úÖ Use a json-server to create a RESTful API for your backend and make both a GET and a POST request to the json server. Use a form to make your post request, specifically a controlled form/component. 

‚úÖ Kept your json-server data simple: avoid nested data and associations.

‚úÖ Add some styling.

## OUR EXPERIENCE MAKING THIS MASTERPIECE
    This was a new experience for Isa, Keegan and I, as working in a team for a coding project was new territory for all us. We had to learn how to manage the gitflow and organizing priorities for the day included morning goals and check-ins throughout the day. We all complimented eachother well in our separate work strategies and always made time to help eachother debug when asked. If two words could describe us, it would be "Dream Team".
